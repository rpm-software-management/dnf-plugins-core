DNF builddep Plugin
===================

Install whatever is needed to build the given .src.rpm, .nosrc.rpm or .spec file.

.. warning:: Build dependencies in a package (i.e. src.rpm) might be different
             than you would expect because they were evaluated according macros
             set on the package build host.
