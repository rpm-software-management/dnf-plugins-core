====================
DNF repoquery Plugin
====================

Query package information from Yum repositories.

--------
Synopsis
--------

``dnf repoquery [<select-options>] [<query-options>] [<pkg-spec>]``
``dnf repoquery --querytags``

-----------
Description
-----------

`repoquery` searches the available Yum repositories for selected packages and displays the requested information about them. It is an equivalent of ``rpm -q`` for remote repositories.


Select Options
--------------

Together with ``<pkg-spec>``, control what packages are displayed in the output. If ``<pkg-spec>`` is given, the set of resulting packages matching the specification. All packages are considered if no ``<pkg-spec>`` is specified.

``<pkg-spec>``
    Package specification like: name[-[epoch:]version[-release]][.arch]. See
    http://dnf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/command_ref.html#specifying-packages

``--arch <arch>[,<arch>...]``
    Limit the resulting set only to packages of selected architectures.

``--duplicated``
    Limit the resulting set to installed duplicated packages (i.e. more package versions
    for the same name and architecture). Installonly packages are excluded from this set.

``-f <file>``, ``--file <file>``
    Limit the resulting set only to package that owns ``<file>``.

``--installonly``
    Limit the resulting set to installed installonly packages.

``--latest-limit <number>``
    Limit the resulting set to <number> of latest packages for every package name and architecture.
    If <number> is negative skip <number> of latest packages.

``--repo <repoid>``
    Limit the resulting set only to packages from repo identified by ``<repoid>``.
    Can be used multiple times with accumulative effect.

``--unsatisfied``
    Report unsatisfied dependencies among installed packages (i.e. missing requires and
    and existing conflicts).

``--whatprovides <capability>``
    Limit the resulting set only to packages that provide ``<capability>``.

``--whatrequires <capability>``
    Limit the resulting set only to packages that require ``<capability>``.

``--alldeps``
    This option is stackable with ``--whatrequires`` only. Additionally it adds to the result set all packages requiring the package features.

``--srpm``
    Operate on corresponding source RPM.

Query Options
-------------

Set what information is displayed about each package.

The following are mutually exclusive, i.e. at most one can be specified. If no query option is given, matching packages are displayed in the standard NEVRA notation.

``--conflicts``
    Display capabilities that the package conflicts with. Same as ``--qf "%{conflicts}``.

.. _info_repoquery-label:

``-i, --info``
    Show detailed information about the package.

``-l, --list``
    Show list of files in the package.

``-s, --source``
    Show package source RPM name.

``--obsoletes``
    Display capabilities that the package obsoletes. Same as ``--qf "%{obsoletes}``.

``--provides``
    Display capabilities provided by the package. Same as ``--qf "%{provides}``.

``--tree``
    For the given packages print a tree of the packages that require them. --tree also requires either of these options to work: --whatrequires --requires --conflicts

``--qf <format>``, ``--queryformat <format>``
    Custom display format. ``<format>`` is a string to output for each matched package. Every occurrence of ``%{<tag>}`` within is replaced by corresponding attribute of the package. List of recognized tags can be displayed by running ``dnf repoquery --querytags``.

``--requires``
    Display capabilities that the package depends on. Same as ``--qf "%{requires}``.

``--resolve``
    resolve capabilities to originating package(s).


--------
Examples
--------

Display NEVRAS of all available packages matching ``light*``::

    dnf repoquery 'light*'

Display requires of all ligttpd packages::

    dnf repoquery --requires lighttpd

Display packages providing the requires of python packages::

    dnf repoquery --requires python --resolve

Display source rpm of ligttpd package::

    dnf repoquery --source lighttpd

Display package name that owns the given file::

    dnf repoquery --file /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

Display name, architecture and the containing repository of all lighttpd packages::

    dnf repoquery --queryformat '%{name}.%{arch} : %{reponame}' lighttpd

Display all available packages providing "webserver"::

    dnf repoquery --whatprovides webserver

Display all available packages providing "webserver" but only for "i686" architecture::

    dnf repoquery --whatprovides webserver --arch i686

Display duplicated packages::

    dnf repoquery --duplicated

Remove older versions of duplicated packages (an equivalent of yum's `package-cleanup --cleandups`)::

    dnf remove $(dnf repoquery --duplicated --latest-limit -1 -q)
