DNF reposync Plugin
====================

Synchronize packages of a remote DNF repository to a local directory.

--------
Synopsis
--------

``dnf reposync [options]``

-----------
Description
-----------

`reposync` makes local copies of remote repositories. Packages that are already present in the local directory are not downloaded again.

-------
Options
-------

All general DNF options are accepted. Namely, the ``--repoid`` option can be used to specify the repositories to synchronize. See `Options` in :manpage:`dnf(8)` for details.

``-a <architecture>, --arch=<architecture>``
    Download only packages of given architectures (default is all architectures). Can be used multiple times.

``--delete``
    Delete local packages no longer present in repository.

``--download-metadata``
    Download all repository metadata. Downloaded copy is instantly usable as a repository, no need to run createrepo_c
    on it. When the option is used with `--newest-only`, only latest packages will be downloaded, but metadata will
    still contain older packages. It might be useful to update metadata using `createrepo_c --update` to remove
    the packages with missing RPM files from metadata. Otherwise, DNF ends with an error due to the missing files
    whenever it tries to download older packages.

``-g, --gpgcheck``
    Remove packages that fail GPG signature checking after downloading. Exit code is ``1`` if at least one package was removed.
    Note that for repositories with ``gpgcheck=0`` set in their configuration the GPG signature is not checked even with this option used.

``-m, --downloadcomps``
    Also download and uncompress comps.xml. Consider using ``--download-metadata`` option which will download all available repository metadata.

``--metadata-path``
    Root path under which the downloaded metadata are stored. It defaults to ``--download-path`` value if not given.

``-n, --newest-only``
    Download only newest packages per-repo.

``--norepopath``
    Don't add the reponame to the download path. Can only be used when syncing a single repository (default is to add the reponame).

``-p <download-path>, --download-path=<download-path>``
    Root path under which the downloaded repositories are stored, relative to the current working directory. Defaults to the current working directory. Every downloaded repository has a subdirectory named after its ID under this path.

``--remote-time``
    Try to set the timestamps of the downloaded files to those on the remote side.

``--source``
    Download only source packages.

``-u, --urls``
    Just print urls of what would be downloaded, don't download.


--------
Examples
--------

``dnf reposync --repoid=the_repo``
    Synchronize all packages from the repository with id "the_repo". The synchronized copy is saved in "the_repo" subdirectory of the current working directory.

``dnf reposync -p /my/repos/path --repoid=the_repo``
    Synchronize all packages from the repository with id "the_repo". In this case files are saved in "/my/repos/path/the_repo" directory.

``dnf reposync --repoid=the_repo --download-metadata``
    Synchronize all packages and metadata from "the_repo" repository.

Repository synchronized with ``--download-metadata`` option can be directly used in DNF for example by using ``--repofrompath`` option:

``dnf --repofrompath=syncedrepo,the_repo --repoid=syncedrepo list --available``
