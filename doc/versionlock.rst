DNF versionlock Plugin
======================

-----------
Description
-----------

`versionlock` is a plugin that takes a set of names and versions for packages and
excludes all other versions of those packages. This allows you to protect
packages from being updated by newer versions. Alternately, it accepts a specific
package version to exclude from updates, e.g. for when it's necessary to skip a
specific release of a package that has known issues.

The plugin provides a command `versionlock` which allows you to view and edit the
list of locked packages easily.

The plugin will walk each line of the versionlock file, and parse out the name and
version of the package. It will then exclude any package by that name that
doesn't match one of the versions listed within the file. This is basically
the same as doing an exclude for the package name itself (as you cannot exclude
installed packages), but dnf will still see the versions you have
installed/versionlocked as available so that `dnf reinstall` will still
work, etc.

It can also work in the opposite way, like a fast exclude,
by prefixing a '!' character to the version. This specifically excludes a package
that matches the version exactly.

Note the versionlock plugin does not apply any excludes in non-transactional
operations like `repoquery`, `list`, `info`, etc.

--------
Synopsis
--------

``dnf versionlock [add|exclude|list|delete|clear] [<package-spec>]``

---------
Arguments
---------

``<package-spec>``
    Package spec to lock or exclude.

-----------
Subcommands
-----------

``dnf versionlock add <package-spec>``
    Add a versionlock for all available packages matching the spec. It means that only versions of
    packages represented by <package-spec> will be available for transaction operations.

``dnf versionlock exclude <package-spec>``
    Add an exclude (within  versionlock) for the available packages matching the spec. It means that
    packages represented by <package-spec> will be excluded from transaction operations.

``dnf versionlock list`` or ``dnf versionlock``
    List the current versionlock entries.

``dnf versionlock delete <package-spec>``
    Remove any matching versionlock entries.

``dnf versionlock clear``
    Remove all versionlock entries.

-------------
Configuration
-------------

``/etc/dnf/plugins/versionlock.conf``

The minimal content of conf file should contain ``main`` sections with ``enabled`` and
``locklist`` parameters.


``locklist``
      This option is a string that points to the file which has the versionlock
      information in it. Note that the file has to exist (or the versionlock plugin
      will make dnf exit). However, it can be empty.

      The file takes entries in the format of ``package-spec`` (optionally prefixed with '!' for
      excludes).
      See :ref:`\specifying_packages-label`.
