To run tests from the source tree, run this
(working directory = root of the source tree):

export PYTHONPATH=./plugins
nosetests tests/

You can run tests under specific Python version using nosetests-2.7
or nosetests-3.4.

On Python2 you need to have the mock module installed before running the tests.
This is not needed when working with Python3 because the tests use
unittest.mock instead.
